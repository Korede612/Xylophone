# Xylophone App
Welcome to the Xylophone App! This project is a part of my journey to master iOS development using Swift. The Xylophone App is a simple and fun application that allows users to play musical notes by tapping on colorful bars.

## Technologies Used
* Storyboard: The user interface is designed using Storyboard, making it easy to visualize and design the app's layout.

* UIKit: UIKit is utilized for building the user interface components and managing the app's navigation.

* AVFoundation API: The AVFoundation framework is used to handle audio playback. It provides the necessary tools for working with audio and video, making it perfect for creating a musical app like the Xylophone.

* Local Audio Source: The app uses local audio files as a source for the xylophone notes. Each bar corresponds to a different note, creating a harmonious and enjoyable experience.
